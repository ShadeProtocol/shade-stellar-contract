# Running the test suite

How the Shade Protocol test suite is organized, how to run all of it or any subset, how the generated `test_snapshots/` directories work, and the conventions to follow when you add a test module.

This page assumes you have a working toolchain — see [Prerequisites and Local Toolchain Setup](prerequisites.md) if `cargo test` does not yet run for you.

## Running tests

Tests compile and run against the **native** build, not WASM. You do not need the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target to run them.

### Everything

```bash
cargo test --workspace --all-features
```

This is exactly what CI runs ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)). `--all-features` matters: each contract crate enables the SDK's `testutils` feature through its `[dev-dependencies]`, and helpers like `Address::generate` and `env.mock_all_auths()` do not exist without it.

The [`Makefile`](../../Makefile) wraps this as `make test`.

### A single crate

```bash
cargo test -p shade
cargo test -p account
cargo test -p escrow
```

`-p <crate-name>` works from anywhere in the workspace and takes the `[package].name` from that crate's `Cargo.toml`. The equivalent long form is:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path contracts/shade/Cargo.toml
```

### A single module

Everything after the crate selection is a substring filter on the full test path, so a module name selects every test inside it:

```bash
cargo test -p shade tests::test_invoice
cargo test -p shade tests::test_upgrade
```

> **Warning:** The filter is a substring match, not a prefix match. `cargo test -p shade tests::test_invoice` also runs `tests::test_invoice_expiry`, `tests::test_invoice_void`, and every other module whose path contains that string. Add `::` and the test name, or `-- --exact`, when you need precision.

### A single test by name

```bash
cargo test -p shade tests::test_upgrade::test_state_persists_after_upgrade -- --exact
```

`--exact` (passed through to the test harness after `--`) requires the full path to match rather than merely contain the filter.

### A single integration test file

For crates using the `tests/` directory layout, each file is its own binary and `--test` selects it by file stem:

```bash
cargo test -p escrow --test test_release
cargo test -p crowdfund --test test_feature_225
```

### Useful flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-- --nocapture` | Prints `std::println!`/`eprintln!` output from passing tests, including the SDK's snapshot-file notices. |
| `-- --exact` | Treats the filter as a full test path rather than a substring. |
| `-- --ignored` | Runs only tests marked `#[ignore]`. |
| `--no-fail-fast` | Keeps going after a crate fails, so you see every failure in one run. |
| `-- --test-threads=1` | Serializes tests; useful when you are reading interleaved output. |

## The two test layouts

The workspace uses two layouts, and which one a crate uses determines what a test can see.

### In-crate unit tests (`src/tests/mod.rs`)

Test modules live inside the crate's own source tree and are compiled as part of the crate under `#[cfg(test)]`. They can reach private items, internal components, and storage keys directly.

Crates on this layout: **`shade`**, **`account`**, **`crowdfund`**, **`crowdfund_factory`**.

It has three levels. The crate root declares the module:

```rust
// contracts/shade/src/lib.rs
#[cfg(test)]
pub mod tests;
```

[`contracts/shade/src/tests/mod.rs`](../../contracts/shade/src/tests/mod.rs) then declares every test file:

```rust
pub mod test;
pub mod test_accepted_tokens;
pub mod test_access_control;
// … one line per file in contracts/shade/src/tests/
```

And each file opens with an inner `#![cfg(test)]` attribute, then imports through `crate::`:

```rust
// contracts/shade/src/tests/test_upgrade.rs
#![cfg(test)]
use crate::shade::{Shade, ShadeClient};
use crate::types::DataKey;
use soroban_sdk::testutils::{Address as _, Events as _};
use soroban_sdk::{Address, BytesN, Env, Map, Symbol, TryIntoVal, Val, Vec};
```

Because the module is inside the crate, this test can read raw storage through `crate::types::DataKey` — something an integration test cannot do:

```rust
let stored_admin: Address = env.as_contract(&contract_id, || {
    env.storage().persistent().get(&DataKey::Admin).unwrap()
});
```

A simpler variant of the same layout skips the `tests/` subdirectory and declares flat files straight from `lib.rs`. **`subscription`**, **`ticketing`**, and **`ticketing_factory`** do this:

```rust
// contracts/subscription/src/lib.rs
#[cfg(test)]
mod test_grace;
#[cfg(test)]
mod test_integration;
#[cfg(test)]
mod test_refund;
#[cfg(test)]
mod test_upgrades_downgrades;
```

Those files start with `use super::*;` rather than `crate::` paths, since they sit directly beneath the crate root.

### Integration tests (`tests/`)

A crate-level `tests/` directory sits beside `src/`. Cargo compiles each file there as a **separate binary that links the crate as an external dependency**, so it sees only the crate's public API — exactly what a downstream integrator sees.

Crates on this layout: **`escrow`** ([`contracts/escrow/tests/`](../../contracts/escrow/tests/)) and **`crowdfund`** ([`contracts/crowdfund/tests/`](../../contracts/crowdfund/tests/)).

```rust
// contracts/escrow/tests/test_initialization.rs
use escrow::{EscrowContract, EscrowContractClient, EscrowStatus};
use soroban_sdk::testutils::Address as _;
use soroban_sdk::{Address, Env};

#[test]
fn test_escrow_creation_initial_state() {
    let env = Env::default();
    env.mock_all_auths();

    let contract_id = env.register(EscrowContract, ());
    let client = EscrowContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
    // …
}
```

Note the differences from the in-crate form: the import is `use escrow::…` (the crate name, not `crate::`), there is no `#![cfg(test)]` and no registration in a `mod.rs`, and anything not `pub` in `escrow` is unreachable. `EscrowContract`'s private `DataKey` enum, for instance, cannot be touched from here.

### Which layout to use

| Use | When |
|---|---|
| `src/tests/` (or flat `src/test_*.rs`) | You need to assert on internal state, call a component function directly, or exercise a private helper. This is the default for new tests in `shade` and `account`. |
| `tests/` | You are testing the contract strictly through its exported client, or verifying that a type or function is actually public. |

> **Note:** [`contracts/escrow/src/test.rs`](../../contracts/escrow/src/test.rs) and [`contracts/escrow/src/integration_test.rs`](../../contracts/escrow/src/integration_test.rs) exist on disk but are not declared in [`contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs`](../../contracts/escrow/src/lib.rs), so Cargo never compiles or runs them. `escrow`'s live tests are the three files under `contracts/escrow/tests/`. Don't add to the orphaned files.

## Test snapshots

### What generates them

Nothing in this repository writes snapshots explicitly — the SDK does it. Every `Env` created with `testutils` enabled writes a JSON snapshot when it is dropped at the end of a test, as long as that `Env` captured something meaningful. `Env::default()` sets `capture_snapshot_at_drop: true`.

Files land under a `test_snapshots/` directory at the crate root, with the test's module path expanded into directories:

```text
contracts/shade/test_snapshots/tests/test_upgrade/test_state_persists_after_upgrade.1.json
```

The trailing number distinguishes multiple `Env` instances created within one test. Running with `-- --nocapture` prints a `Writing test snapshot file for test …` line per file written.

### What they capture

A snapshot is the observable state of the test's Soroban host at the moment the `Env` was dropped:

- **`ledger.entries`** — every ledger entry the test created or touched: contract instances, uploaded WASM, contract data, and their TTLs.
- **`events`** — the contract and system events emitted during the test.
- **`auth`** — the authorization tree that was required and satisfied.

A snapshot with none of those three is skipped, so a test that only reads a getter produces no file.

### Whether to commit them

**Not in this repository.** [`.gitignore`](../../.gitignore) ignores them workspace-wide:

```text
# Test snapshots
test_snapshots/
```

The SDK's own guidance is to commit snapshots so that behavior changes show up as diffs across contract edits, SDK upgrades, and protocol upgrades. Shade has deliberately not adopted that: the suite spans hundreds of tests across nine crates, and the snapshots would dominate every diff. Behavior is asserted explicitly in test bodies instead — see [Asserting on events](#asserting-on-events) below.

The practical consequences:

- A `test_snapshots/` directory appearing in your working tree after `cargo test` is expected. Leave it alone; git already ignores it.
- Never `git add -f` a snapshot file.
- If you want a durable snapshot for one specific investigation, write it somewhere explicit with `env.to_snapshot_file("path.json")` rather than relying on the drop behavior.

### Regenerating and reading them

There is no separate regeneration command and no "accept new snapshot" step — the files are rewritten from scratch on every run:

```bash
# Refresh everything
cargo test --workspace --all-features

# Refresh just one crate's snapshots
rm -rf contracts/shade/test_snapshots
cargo test -p shade
```

To compare behavior before and after a change, copy the directory aside, make the change, re-run, and diff:

```bash
cargo test -p shade
cp -r contracts/shade/test_snapshots /tmp/snapshots-before
# … make your change …
cargo test -p shade
diff -r /tmp/snapshots-before contracts/shade/test_snapshots
```

To suppress snapshot writing entirely in a test — worth doing for a test that creates many `Env`s in a loop — build the `Env` with an explicit config:

```rust
use soroban_sdk::testutils::EnvTestConfig;
use soroban_sdk::Env;

let env = Env::new_with_config(EnvTestConfig {
    capture_snapshot_at_drop: false,
});
```

`env.set_config(…)` changes the setting on an `Env` you already hold.

## Writing a new test module

### Naming and registration

1. Name the file `test_<subject>.rs` — `test_invoice_expiry.rs`, `test_platform_fee.rs`. Feature-numbered names (`test_feature_211.rs`) exist for work tracked to a specific issue; prefer a descriptive name for anything else.
2. Put it in `src/tests/` for `shade`, `account`, `crowdfund`, and `crowdfund_factory`; in `tests/` for `escrow`.
3. Start an in-crate file with `#![cfg(test)]` as its first line.
4. **Register it.** In `src/tests/`, add a `pub mod test_<subject>;` line to that crate's `mod.rs`. An unregistered file compiles as nothing and silently runs zero tests. Files under `tests/` need no registration.
5. Name each test function `test_<behavior>` and make the name describe the assertion, not the call: `test_state_persists_after_upgrade`, not `test_upgrade_2`.

> **Warning:** Declaring the same module twice in a `mod.rs` is a compile error, and so is declaring a module whose file you later delete. If a crate stops compiling right after you touch a test, check `mod.rs` first.

### Setting up the environment

Almost every test starts the same way — construct the `Env`, register the contract, wrap it in the generated client:

```rust
let env = Env::default();
let contract_id = env.register(Shade, ());
let client = ShadeClient::new(&env, &contract_id);
```

Crates with a lot of shared setup factor it into a private helper, which is the pattern to follow:

```rust
// contracts/shade/src/tests/test_access_control.rs
fn setup_test(env: &Env) -> (ShadeClient<'_>, Address) {
    let contract_id = env.register(Shade, ());
    let client = ShadeClient::new(env, &contract_id);
    let admin = Address::generate(env);
    client.initialize(&admin);
    (client, admin)
}
```

### `mock_all_auths` versus explicit auth

Every state-changing entry point in Shade calls `require_auth()` on the acting address, so a test must either satisfy or deliberately withhold that authorization.

**Use `env.mock_all_auths()` when authorization is not what you are testing.** It approves every `require_auth` in the test, letting you focus on the behavior under test:

```rust
let env = Env::default();
env.mock_all_auths();
let (client, admin) = setup_test(&env);

client.grant_role(&admin, &user, &Role::Manager);
assert!(client.has_role(&user, &Role::Manager));
```

**Omit it, or use `mock_auths` with an explicit list, when authorization *is* what you are testing.** `mock_auths` grants exactly the authorizations you name and nothing else, so an unauthorized caller genuinely fails:

```rust
// contracts/shade/src/tests/test_admin_transfer.rs
use soroban_sdk::testutils::{MockAuth, MockAuthInvoke};

let env = Env::default();                       // note: no mock_all_auths
let (client, _admin) = setup_test(&env);

env.mock_auths(&[MockAuth {
    address: &malicious,
    invoke: &MockAuthInvoke {
        contract: &client.address,
        fn_name: "propose_admin_transfer",
        args: (&malicious, &new_admin).into_val(&env),
        sub_invokes: &[],
    },
}]);

let result = client.try_propose_admin_transfer(&malicious, &new_admin);
assert!(result.is_err());
```

Here `malicious` really does sign the call, so the test proves the contract's own `assert_admin` check rejects it — not merely that a signature was missing. That distinction is the reason to reach for `mock_auths`.

> **Security:** A negative authorization test written under `mock_all_auths()` proves nothing about access control if the contract never called `require_auth` at all. When the assertion is "this caller must be rejected," write it with `mock_auths` or with no mocking.

### Asserting on expected panics and errors

Two forms, and they are not interchangeable.

**`#[should_panic]`** asserts the whole call traps, matching on the rendered host error. The number is the discriminant from that crate's error enum ([`contracts/shade/src/errors.rs`](../../contracts/shade/src/errors.rs)):

```rust
#[should_panic(expected = "HostError: Error(Contract, #2)")]
#[test]
fn test_initialize_twice() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register(Shade, ());
    let client = ShadeClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let admin = Address::generate(&env);
    client.initialize(&admin);
    client.initialize(&admin);
}
```

**`try_*` plus a typed comparison** is the stronger form: every generated client method has a `try_` twin that returns a `Result` instead of trapping, so the test can name the error by its variant rather than by a magic number, and can keep asserting afterwards:

```rust
// contracts/shade/src/tests/test_accepted_tokens.rs
use crate::errors::ContractError;

let expected_error =
    soroban_sdk::Error::from_contract_error(ContractError::NotAuthorized as u32);

let add_result = client.try_add_accepted_token(&non_admin, &token);
assert!(matches!(add_result, Err(Ok(err)) if err == expected_error));

client.add_accepted_token(&admin, &token);
let remove_result = client.try_remove_accepted_token(&non_admin, &token);
assert!(matches!(remove_result, Err(Ok(err)) if err == expected_error));
assert!(client.is_accepted_token(&token));
```

The nesting reads: the outer `Err` means the invocation failed; the inner `Ok(err)` means it failed with a recognized contract error rather than an unrecognized host error. Prefer this form — it survives renumbering of the error enum, and it lets one test cover several rejection paths.

### Asserting on events

Import the `Events` testutils trait and read `env.events().all()`. Events are appended in order, so the event you just triggered is the last entry:

```rust
// contracts/shade/src/tests/test_upgrade.rs
use soroban_sdk::testutils::Events as _;

fn assert_latest_upgrade_event(
    env: &Env,
    contract_id: &Address,
    expected_hash: &BytesN<32>,
    expected_timestamp: u64,
) {
    let events = env.events().all();
    assert!(!events.is_empty());

    let (event_contract_id, topics, data) = events.get(events.len() - 1).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(event_contract_id, contract_id.clone());
    assert_eq!(topics.len(), 1);

    let event_name: Symbol = topics.get(0).unwrap().try_into_val(env).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(event_name, Symbol::new(env, "contract_upgraded_event"));

    let data_map: Map<Symbol, Val> = data.try_into_val(env).unwrap();
    let hash_val = data_map.get(Symbol::new(env, "new_wasm_hash")).unwrap();
    let timestamp_val = data_map.get(Symbol::new(env, "timestamp")).unwrap();

    let hash_in_event: BytesN<32> = hash_val.try_into_val(env).unwrap();
    let timestamp_in_event: u64 = timestamp_val.try_into_val(env).unwrap();

    assert_eq!(hash_in_event, expected_hash.clone());
    assert_eq!(timestamp_in_event, expected_timestamp);
}
```

Three things to copy from this helper:

- Each tuple is `(contract_id, topics, data)`. Assert on the contract id too — a cross-contract call emits events from more than one address.
- The topic is the event name as a `Symbol`. `#[contractevent]` derives it from the struct name in snake case, so `ContractUpgradedEvent` publishes under `contract_upgraded_event`.
- The payload is a `Map<Symbol, Val>` keyed by the struct's field names. Convert each field with `try_into_val` and compare against a typed value, never against a string.

Factor this into a `fn assert_latest_*_event` helper at the top of the module when more than one test in the file checks the same event.

### Checklist for adding a test module

- [ ] File is named `test_<subject>.rs` and lives in the layout the crate uses.
- [ ] In-crate files begin with `#![cfg(test)]`.
- [ ] `pub mod test_<subject>;` added to the crate's `src/tests/mod.rs` (in-crate layout only).
- [ ] Shared setup is a private `fn setup_*` helper, not copy-pasted per test.
- [ ] `env.mock_all_auths()` used only where authorization is not the subject; negative auth tests use `mock_auths` or no mocking.
- [ ] Failure cases assert a named `ContractError` via `try_*`, or a `#[should_panic]` string with the matching discriminant.
- [ ] Emitted events are asserted by name and field, not just counted.
- [ ] `cargo test -p <crate>` passes, and `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings` are clean.
- [ ] No `test_snapshots/` file staged in the commit.
