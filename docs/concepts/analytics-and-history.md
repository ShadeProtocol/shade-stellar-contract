# Merchant analytics and transaction history

The Shade contract accumulates per-[merchant](../glossary.md#merchant), per-token analytics and a per-user transaction log on-chain. This page documents what is tracked, how to read it, and what it does not cover.

## Why it exists

[Merchants](../glossary.md#merchant) and integrators need visibility into on-chain payment volume, fee revenue, and transaction history without relying solely on external indexers. The analytics system provides a read-optimized summary that can be queried directly from the contract.

## How it works

### Analytics recording

Every successful invoice payment or subscription charge calls `record_merchant_payment`, which atomically updates three analytics stores:

1. **Per-merchant, per-token** (`MerchantAnalytics`) — volume, fees, and count for a specific merchant and token pair.
2. **Per-merchant summary** (`MerchantAnalyticsSummary`) — aggregated across all tokens for a given merchant.
3. **Per-token global** (`TokenAnalytics`) — volume, fees, count, and unique merchant count across all merchants using that token.

### Transaction history

Every payment also records a `Transaction` entry in the user's transaction log via `record_transaction`. The log is append-only and grows with each payment.

## What analytics do not cover

- **Refund adjustments.** Refunds do not reduce `total_volume`, `total_fees`, or `transaction_count`. The analytics reflect gross activity, not net.
- **Off-chain activity.** Payments settled entirely off-chain or through external systems are invisible to on-chain analytics.
- **Event ticketing volume.** Analytics are updated by `record_merchant_payment` (invoice and subscription flows). Ticket purchases use a separate flow and are not reflected in these counters.
- **Expired or pruned data.** On-chain data persists indefinitely; there is no automatic pruning. The `last_updated` field indicates freshness but does not expire.

## On-chain analytics vs. event indexing

| Approach | Cost | Freshness | Completeness |
|---|---|---|---|
| On-chain read (`get_merchant_analytics`) | Low — single contract read | Real-time | Only aggregated summaries |
| Event indexing | Higher — requires off-chain infrastructure | Near real-time | Full event stream with every field |

Use on-chain analytics for dashboards, quick queries, and verification. Use event indexing when you need per-event granularity, historical replay, or cross-contract correlation.

> **Note:** The `last_updated` field is set on every payment. If a [merchant](../glossary.md#merchant) has no recent activity, the timestamp reflects the last payment, not the current time.
