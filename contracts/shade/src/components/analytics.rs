//! Campaign analytics and creator data exports.
//!
//! A creator running a backer campaign needs their raise as *data*: how many
//! people backed it, how the average contribution moved, what came in since
//! they last looked. The chain holds every contribution already, but only as a
//! stream of individual pledges — answering "what is my average pledge" from it
//! means replaying the campaign's whole history.
//!
//! This component keeps that answer as it goes. Every contribution to a backer
//! campaign folds into a small running aggregate ([`CampaignStats`]), and a
//! creator can snapshot that aggregate at any time into an immutable
//! [`AnalyticsExport`] record which is also emitted as an event for off-chain
//! tooling to render as CSV or JSON.
//!
//! # What an export is, and is not
//!
//! The contract does not build a file. It publishes the *figures*, the format
//! the creator asked for, and the window they cover; indexers and UIs turn that
//! into bytes. Storing the intent on-chain is what makes an export reproducible
//! — anyone can rebuild the identical file from the same snapshot, and the
//! creator's authorization for it is on the ledger.
//!
//! Per-backer rows are deliberately not part of an export. Producing them
//! on-chain would need a backer roster that grows without bound and is walked
//! in full on every export, which is exactly the shape that makes a Soroban
//! call unaffordable at the size where the export starts to matter. The
//! per-pledge events this component and [`crate::components::backer_rewards`]
//! emit already carry every row an indexer needs, so rows are reconstructed
//! off-chain and the on-chain cost stays flat in the number of backers.
//!
//! # Incremental exports
//!
//! Consecutive exports partition the campaign's timeline: each covers
//! everything since the previous one's `period_end`. The delta is computed from
//! a *counter* cursor stored alongside the aggregate, not from timestamps, so
//! two exports in the same ledger second still partition the data exactly —
//! the second sees the first's cursor and reports a zero delta rather than
//! double-counting the contributions they share a second with.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Only the campaign's owning merchant may export it. Reads are public:
//!   backers being able to audit a creator's published figures is the point.
//! - Every counter in [`CampaignStats`] only ever grows, and an export never
//!   mutates them — it only advances the cursor. Exports are immutable once
//!   written and there is no update or delete path.
//! - `tracked_raised` counts what this component observed. A campaign's own
//!   `BackerCampaign::raised` stays authoritative and is carried on every
//!   export beside it, so a campaign that took contributions before this
//!   component shipped reports a short tracked total rather than a wrong
//!   authoritative one.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! Keys live in [`AnalyticsKey`], a dedicated enum, so this feature adds no
//! cases to the near-full `CampaignKey` (Soroban caps every enum at 50 cases).
//! The aggregate and its export cursor share one entry keyed by `campaign_id`,
//! so recording a contribution and running an export each cost a single
//! read-modify-write. Derived figures (averages, deltas) are computed on demand
//! rather than stored — nothing pays rent to hold a number the next
//! contribution invalidates.
