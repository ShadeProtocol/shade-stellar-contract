//! Fiat-pegged funding goals for crowdfunding campaigns.
//!
//! A campaign's `goal_amount` is denominated in its token, which makes "raise
//! $10,000" impossible to express: the token's fiat value drifts under the
//! campaign for its whole duration. A merchant can instead peg the target to a
//! fiat currency here. Contributions still arrive in the token, but each is
//! valued in fiat through the token's price oracle — the same oracle registry
//! the fiat-invoice engine uses — and it is that fiat total the target is
//! measured against.
//!
//! Pegs attach to the campaign registry in [`crate::components::campaigns`]
//! (the [`Campaign`] record that stretch goals also build on), not to the
//! all-or-nothing pledge campaigns in [`crate::components::pledge`].
//!
//! # Valuation model
//!
//! Every contribution is valued **once**, at the price of the ledger it landed
//! on, and that snapshot accrues into `raised_amount`. The alternative —
//! revaluing the whole raise at the current price — would let a price swing
//! move a campaign back below a target it had already met, so a goal could be
//! reached, unreached, then reached again. Snapshotting makes progress
//! monotonic: the total only ever grows, and `reached_at` is set once.
//!
//! The token→fiat conversion is the exact inverse of the fiat→token conversion
//! [`crate::components::invoice`] applies to fiat invoices, so a fiat invoice
//! and a fiat goal price the same trade identically.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Only the campaign's owning merchant may publish a peg or refresh its
//!   quote; the merchant or the contract admin may close one.
//! - A campaign has at most one peg, and its `currency`, `goal_amount` and
//!   `decimals` never change once published — backers can rely on the target
//!   they were shown. Closing is the one state change available.
//! - `raised_amount`, `raised_tokens` and `contribution_count` only ever grow,
//!   and `status` only ever moves forward (`Active` → `Reached` → `Closed`).
//! - A peg cannot be published against a token with no configured oracle, or
//!   one whose oracle has no usable price, so a published target is always
//!   measurable.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! Keys live in [`FiatGoalKey`], a dedicated enum, so this feature adds no
//! cases to the near-full `CampaignKey` (Soroban caps every enum at 50 cases).
//! A peg is keyed by its `campaign_id` rather than a fresh ID, which avoids a
//! counter entry entirely and keeps lookups to one read. Live valuations are
//! derived on demand rather than stored, so nothing pays rent to hold a figure
//! that the next price tick invalidates.
