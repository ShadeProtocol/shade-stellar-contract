//! Stretch-goal milestones for overfunded campaigns.
//!
//! A stretch goal is a funding milestone *beyond* a campaign's base goal. The
//! owning merchant defines goals up front; each unlocks once the campaign's
//! cumulative raise reaches its `target_amount`. Once unlocked, the merchant
//! grants per-backer rewards which backers then claim.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Only the campaign's owning merchant may create, unlock, cancel or grant
//!   rewards for its goals. Backers may only claim their own reward.
//! - `target_amount` must exceed the campaign's base `goal_amount` (a milestone
//!   at or below the base goal is not a *stretch* goal) and must be strictly
//!   greater than every existing goal on the campaign, so a campaign's goals
//!   form a strictly increasing ladder.
//! - A goal can only leave `Pending` once, so concurrent `unlock_stretch_goal`
//!   calls cannot double-emit or double-count.
//! - Rewards are keyed by `(goal_id, backer)`, so one goal serves any number of
//!   backers, and a backer can be granted at most one reward per goal.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! Keys live in [`StretchKey`], a dedicated key enum, so this feature adds no
//! pressure to the core `DataKey` enum (Soroban caps every enum at 50 cases).
//! The reverse index [`StretchKey::CampaignStretchGoals`] holds only `u64` IDs
//! rather than whole records, keeping the per-campaign entry small and cheap to
//! extend as goals are added.
