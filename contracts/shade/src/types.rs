//! Contract data types and persistent storage keys.
//!
//! # Storage key layout
//!
//! Soroban hard-caps every `#[contracttype]` enum at **50 cases**. A single
//! monolithic `DataKey` had grown past that limit, so keys are partitioned into
//! one enum per feature domain. Each enum is an independent `#[contracttype]`,
//! so they never collide with one another and each stays comfortably under the
//! cap with room for future variants:
//!
//! - [`DataKey`]     — core payments: admin, merchants, invoices,
//!   subscriptions, fees, analytics, escrow
//! - [`EventKey`]    — ticketing / events
//! - [`CampaignKey`] — crowdfunding campaigns, categories, tags, pledges,
//!   comments, vesting, hard-cap voting, leaderboards
//! - [`BackerKey`]   — backer reward tiers and perks
//! - [`StretchKey`]  — stretch-goal milestones
//! - [`VestingKey`]  — creator fund vesting
//! - [`FiatGoalKey`] — fiat-pegged campaign goals
//! - [`NftKey`]      — NFT reward collections
//! - [`GovKey`]      — DAO governance
//! - [`BridgeKey`]   — cross-chain bridge and pledges
//! - [`MultiSigKey`] — multi-sig massive withdrawals
